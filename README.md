# Flight-simulator_with_SD_for-UrbanTransportation-planing

This GitHub repository contains the source code and supplementary material of the research paper entitled *"White-box flight simulator built with system dynamics to support urban transportation decision-making and address induced travel demand"*.

### Source code:

Folders <b>dcu</b>, <b>images</b> and <b>source</b> contain the source code of the flight simulator coded in Delphi 7.0 (event-driven programming language based on Object Pascal).

You have to download and save these folders in the same location. In order to launch the flight simulator, you first have to go inside the <b>source</b> folder and then just execute the Project1.exe file.

### Supplementary material:

Folder <b>SD_models</b> contains the System Dynamic model (both English and Spanish versions) used by the flight simulator. This model was built in Evolución, a software package developed by SIMON research group (<a href="http://simon.uis.edu.co/">Showing Text</a>) to model and simulate with SD. In this same folder, the reader can find the .exe file (named <b>evolucion_45_Beta.exe</b>) of Evolución for its installation.
