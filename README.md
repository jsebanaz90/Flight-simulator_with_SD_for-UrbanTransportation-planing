# Flight-simulator_with_SD_for-UrbanTransportation-planing

This GitHug repository contains the source code and supplementary material of the research paper entitled *"White-box flight simulator built with system dynamics to support urban transportation decision-making and address induced travel demand"*.

### Source code:

Folders <b>dcu</b>, <b>images</b> and <b>source</b> contain the source code of the flight simulator coded in Delphi 7.0 (event-driven programming language based on Object Pascal).

You have to download and save these folders in the same location. In order to launch the flight simulator, you first have to go inside the <b>source</b> folder and then just execute the Project1.exe file.

### Supplementary material:

Folder <b>SD_models</b> contains the System Dynamic model used by the flight simulator as simulation engine. This model was developed in Evolución, a software package to build SD models. In this same folder, the read can find the .exe file (named <b>evolucion_45_Beta.exe</b>) of Evolución for its installation.
